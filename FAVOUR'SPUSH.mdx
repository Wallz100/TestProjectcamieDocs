# FAVOUR'SPUSH

Progress rarely comes from motivation alone. It comes from **consistent pressure applied in the right direction**.  
That is what *FAVOUR'SPUSH* represents.

## What This Means

**FAVOUR'SPUSH** is the idea that growth is created by:
- Small actions executed repeatedly
- Systems that reduce friction
- Feedback loops that enforce learning

It is not about rushing.  
It is about *moving forward without stopping*.

## The Core Principles

### 1. Systems Over Motivation
Motivation fluctuates. Systems compound.

If a process works on your worst day, it will dominate on your best day.

### 2. Feedback Is Fuel
Mistakes are not failures—they are signals.
A system that **learns daily** will always outperform one that reacts emotionally.

### 3. Automation Is Leverage
Anything repeated should be automated.
Anything automated should be monitored.
Anything monitored should improve itself.

> Push once manually.  
> Push forever with systems.

## Applied Example (Conceptual)

```ts
// Progress is not accidental
const pushForward = (effort: number, consistency: boolean) => {
  if (!consistency) return "stagnation";
  return effort * 365;
};
